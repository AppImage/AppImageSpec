## Specification

### Image format

The image format determines how an [AppImage] is represented on disk. Currently there is only one defined image format, however, there could be additional image formats in the future.

#### Type 0 image format

Reserved for not fully standards-compliant AppImages (e.g., portable binaries that look and behave like AppImages on a user level, but do not conform to a standard on a programming level). 

#### Type 1 image format

An [AppImage] which conforms to the type 1 image format:

* **MUST** be an [ISO 9660](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-119.htm) file
* **MUST** use [Rock Ridge](http://www.ymi.com/ymi/sites/default/files/pdf/Rockridge.pdf) extensions
* **MAY** use [Joliet](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/125630) extensions
* **SHOULD** use [zisofs](http://libburnia-project.org/wiki/zisofs) compression
* **MUST** be a valid [ELF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format) executable 
* **MUST**, when executed, mount the [AppImage] and execute the executable file `AppRun` contained in the root of the ISO 9660 filesystem
* **MUST NOT** rely on any specific file name extension, although it is **RECOMMENDED** that the file name extension `.AppImage` is used whenever a file name extension is desired. Futher it is **RECOMMENDED** to follow the naming scheme `ApplicationName-$VERSION-$ARCH.AppImage` in cases in which it is desired to convey this information in the file name
* **SHOULD** not be encapsulated in another archive/container format during download or when stored
* **MUST** work when spaces are used in its own filesystem path, in its own file name and in paths and filenames it uses internally
* **MAY** embed [update information] in the ISO 9660 Volume Descriptor field (offset 33651). If the information in this location is not in one of the known [update information] formats, then it **SHOULD** be empty and/or be ignored
* **SHOULD** contain the magic hex `0x414901` at offset 8 ([why?](https://github.com/probonopd/AppImageKit/issues/144))

#### Type 2 image format

An [AppImage] which conforms to the type 2 image format:

* **MUST** be a valid [ELF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format) executable 
* **MUST** have appended to it a filesystem that the ELF part can mount
* **MUST**, when executed, mount the [AppImage] and execute the executable file `AppRun` contained in the root of the filesystem image
* **MUST NOT** rely on any specific file name extension, although it is **RECOMMENDED** that the file name extension `.AppImage` is used whenever a file name extension is desired. Futher it is **RECOMMENDED** to follow the naming scheme `ApplicationName-$VERSION-$ARCH.AppImage` in cases in which it is desired to convey this information in the file name
* **SHOULD** not be encapsulated in another archive/container format during download or when stored
* **MUST** work when spaces are used in its own filesystem path, in its own file name and in paths and filenames it uses internally
* **MAY** embed [update information] in the ELF section `.upd_info`. If the information in this location is not in one of the known [update information] formats, then it **SHOULD** be empty and/or be ignored
* **MAY** embed a digital signature in the ELF section `.sha256_sig`. If this section exists then it **MUST** either be empty (filled with `0x00` padding) or contain a valid digital signature of the sha256 of the AppImage assuming the ELF section `.sha256_sig` being filled with `0x00` padding ([why?](https://github.com/probonopd/AppImageKit/issues/238#issuecomment-249412813))
* **MAY** embed a digital signature in the ELF section `.sha256_sig`. If this section exists then it **MUST** **EITHER** be empty (filled with `0x00` padding) **OR** start with an OpenGPG ASCII Armored block as defined per [RFC 4880](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880) containing a detached signature. Trailing space SHOULD be filled with `0x00` padding. Keep special attention to the following RFC note:

  > Note that all these Armor Header Lines are to consist of a complete
    line.  That is to say, there is always a line ending preceding the
    starting five dashes, and following the ending five dashes.  The
    header lines, therefore, MUST start at the beginning of a line, and
    MUST NOT have text other than whitespace following them on the same
    line.

  * This means that a valid digital signature **MUST** begin with a newline character, and end with a newline character, and **SHOULD** be followed by as many `0x00` bytes as required in order to fill the ELF section.
  * The signed plaintext **MUST** be the ASCII string that results from converting into hexadecimal notation the binary bytes of the SHA-256 hash of the ELF file when substituting the `.sha256_sig` and `.upd_info` ELF sections with `0x00` padding.

* **MUST** contain the magic hex `0x414902` at offset 8 ([why?](https://github.com/probonopd/AppImageKit/issues/144))

### Contents of the image

#### The filesystem image:

* Is an [AppDir]
* **MUST** contain a file named `AppRun` in its root directory
* **SHOULD** contain a [payload application] that is ultimately executed when the [AppImage] is executed
* **SHOULD** contain exactly one `$APPNAME.desktop` file in its root directory with `$APPNAME` being the name of the [payload application]
* **SHOULD** contain icon files below `usr/share/icons/hicolor` following the  [Icon Theme Specification](https://standards.freedesktop.org/icon-theme-spec/icon-theme-spec-latest.html) for the icon identifier as set in the `Icon=` key of the `$APPNAME.desktop` file. If present, these icon files **SHOULD** be given preference as the icon being used to represent the [AppImage].
* **MAY** contain an `$APPICON.svg`, `$APPICON.svgz` or `$APPICON.png` file in its root directory with `$APPICON` being the icon identifier as set in the `Icon=` key of the `$APPNAME.desktop` file. If present and no icon files matching the icon identifier present below `usr/share/icons/hicolor`, this icon **SHOULD** be given preference as the icon being used to represent the [AppImage]. If a PNG file, the icon **SHOULD** be of size 256x256, 512x512, or 1024x1024 pixels.
* **MUST** contain a `.DirIcon` file as per the [AppDir] specification which **SHOULD** be a 256x256 PNG file.

#### The `AppRun` file:

* **MUST** be executable and, when executed, launch the [payload application] either directly or indirectly (i.e., by invoking other helper binaries or scripts which, in turn, launch the [payload application])
* **MAY** be an ELF binary or an interpreted script
* If it is an ELF binary, it **SHOULD** have as few runtime dependencies as possible
* If it is an interpreted script, it **SHOULD** be written in a language in which an interpreter can be assumed to be available on every [target system]
* **MUST** work even when stored in a filesystem path that contains blanks
* **SHOULD** pass any arguments passed to it to the [payload application] either directly or indirectly (i.e., by invoking other helper binaries or scripts which, in turn, launch the [payload application]) if it is not explicitly deemed useful otherwise
* **SHOULD** pass any environment variables passed to it to the [payload application] either directly or indirectly (i.e., by invoking other helper binaries or scripts which, in turn, launch the [payload application]) if it is not explicitly deemed useful otherwise
* **MAY** `cd` to a directory inside the [AppImage] at runtime before executing the [payload application], commonly `./usr/` 

#### The [payload application]:

* **MAY** be an ELF binary or an interpreted script
* If it is an ELF binary, it **SHOULD** have as few dynamic library dependencies as possible and each dynamic library dependency **MUST** be included in the [AppImage] *IF* it cannot be assumed to be part of every [target system] in a recent enough version
* If it is an interpreted script, it **SHOULD** be written in a language in which an interpreter can be assumed to be available on every [target system], otherwise the interpreter **MUST** be included in the [AppImage]
* It is **RECOMMENDED** that the [payload application] and its dependencies are located in a `$PREFIX` directory tree inside the [AppDir] with `$PREFIX` commonly being `./usr/`; it is **RECOMMENDED** that the `$PREFIX` directory tree inside the [AppDir] follows the [File System Hierarchy conventions for `/usr`](https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_3.0/fhs/ch04.html)

### Metadata

Section to be expanded; additional metadata is being discussed on <https://github.com/probonopd/AppImageKit/issues/59>

#### AppStream

An [AppImage] **SHOULD** ship AppStream metadata in `usr/share/metainfo/$ID.appdata.xml` with `$ID` being the AppStream ID. Shipping AppStream information enables the [AppImage] to be discoverable in application centers and/or application directory websites. If it does, then it **MUST** follow the AppStream [guidelines for applications](https://github.com/hughsie/appstream-glib#guidelines-for-applications). See [examples](https://packages.debian.org/search?searchon=contents&keywords=appdata.xml&mode=filename&suite=unstable&arch=any) for such files in the debian repository.

#### Update information

An [AppImage] **MAY** have [update information] embedded for exactly one transport mechanism. The location in which this information is stored is defined by the [image format](#image-format). Currently three transport mechanisms are available, but only one can be used for each given [AppImage]:

 * [`zsync`](#zsync)
 * [`bintray-zsync`](#bintray-zsync)
 * [`gh-releases-zsync`](#github-releases)
 
*Several tools such as `appimagetool` can create the `.zsync` file automatically when building the AppImage. Please refer to the [guide](https://docs.appimage.org/packaging-guide/optional/updates.html#using-appimagetool) for further information.*
 
##### zsync

The __[zsync]__ transport requires a HTTP server that can handle HTTP range requests. Its [update information] is in the form

```
zsync|https://server.domain/path/Application-latest-x86_64.AppImage.zsync
```

If an [AppImage] has [update information] embedded for this transport mechanism, then the following fields **MUST** be used; separated by a "|" character:

Field | Type | Example | Comments
----------- | ------ | -------- | --------
Transport mechanism | String | `zsync` | [zsync] file and [AppImage] **MUST** be stored on  [compatible](http://zsync.moria.org.uk/server-issues) HTTP server
zsync file URL | String | `https://server.domain/path/Application-latest-x86_64.AppImage.zsync` | URL to the `.zsync` file (URL **MUST NOT** change from version to version)

For an overview about [zsync] and how to create `.zsync` files, see [http://zsync.moria.org.uk/](http://zsync.moria.org.uk/).

##### GitHub Releases

The __GitHub Releases__ transport extends the [zsync] transport in that it uses version information from [GitHub Releases](https://help.github.com/articles/about-releases/). Its [update information] is in the form

```
gh-releases-zsync|probono|AppImages|latest|Subsurface-*x86_64.AppImage.zsync
```

If an [AppImage] has [update information] embedded for this transport mechanism, then the following fields **MUST** be used; separated by a "|" character:

Field | Type | Example | Comments
----------- | ------ | -------- | --------
Transport mechanism | String | `gh-releases-zsync` | [zsync] file and [AppImage] **MUST** be stored on GitHub Releases
GitHub username | String | `probono` | Name of the GitHub user or organization of the account where the [zsync] file and [AppImage] are stored
GitHub repository | String | `AppImages` | Name of the GitHub repository in which the [zsync] file and [AppImage] are stored
Release name | String | `latest` | Name of the release. `latest` will automatically use the latest release as determined by the GitHub API
Filename | String | `Subsurface-*x86_64.AppImage.zsync` | Filename of the [zsync] file on GitHub, `*` is a wildcard

**Please note that pre-releases are not being considered when using `latest`.** You will have to explicitly provide the name of a release. When using e.g., [uploadtool](https://github.com/probonopd/uploadtool), the name of the release created will always be `continuous`, hence, you can just specify that value instead of `latest`.


##### bintray-zsync

The __bintray-zsync__ transport extends the [zsync] transport in that it uses version information from [Bintray](https://bintray.com/). Its [update information] is in the form

```
bintray-zsync|probono|AppImages|Subsurface|Subsurface-_latestVersion-x86_64.AppImage.zsync
```

If an [AppImage] has [update information] embedded for this transport mechanism, then the following fields **MUST** be used; separated by a "|" character:

Field | Type | Example | Comments
----------- | ------ | -------- | --------
Transport mechanism | String | `bintray-zsync` | [zsync] file and [AppImage] **MUST** be stored on Bintray
Bintray username | String | `probono` | Name of the user or organization of the account where the [zsync] file and [AppImage] are stored
Bintray repository | String | `AppImages` | Name of the repository in which the [zsync] file and [AppImage] are stored
Bintray package name | String | `Subsurface` | Name of the [Bintray package](https://bintray.com/docs/usermanual/uploads/uploads_creatinganewpackage.html) in which the [zsync] file and [AppImage] are stored
Bintray zsync path | String | `Subsurface-_latestVersion-x86_64.AppImage.zsync` | Path where the [zsync] file is stored on Bintray (**MUST NOT** change from version to version). Note the use of the Bintray feature `_latestVersion` to facilitate this

### Desktop integration

The software inside the [AppImage] **MAY** integrate into the desktop environment (e.g., by installing a [.desktop file] into the host system) on the user's behalf. However if it does so, it *SHOULD* ensure to get the explicit permission of the user, e.g., by asking for permission in a GUI window, or by reacting to a command line argument.

The software inside the [AppImage] **SHOULD NOT** attempt to do desktop integration if at least one of the following conditions are met:

* A file `$HOME/.local/share/appimagekit/no_desktopintegration` exists on the [target system]
* A file `/usr/share/appimagekit/no_desktopintegration` exists on the [target system]
* A file `/etc/appimagekit/no_desktopintegration` exists on the [target system]
* A process named `appimaged` is running on the system
* The environment variable `$DESKTOPINTEGRATION` is not empty
